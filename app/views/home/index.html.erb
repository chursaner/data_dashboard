      <p>We are sharing city data with the public to increase transparency, accountability and customer service and to empower companies, individuals and non-profit organizations with the ability to harness a vast array of useful information to improve life in our city. I hope that this data will help drive innovation and problem solving within the public and private sectors and that Angelenos will use it to more deeply understand and engage with their city. I encourage you to explore data.lacity.org to conduct research, develop apps or simply to poke around.</p>
